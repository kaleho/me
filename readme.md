### SUMMARY

As a solution and software architect with twenty years of experience, I combine my leadership in team settings with strong individual contributions, particularly in developing scalable web applications and services. My expertise lies not only in leading and mentoring teams but also in hands-on development and problem-solving. While I am passionate about the capabilities of technology, I firmly believe that the heart of success lies in people and processes. I advocate for technology that empowers users, both employees and customers, streamlining their experience and driving organizational growth. Roadblocks to adoption diminish when technology enhances user experience, accelerating the organizationâ€™s progress. I am a proponent of agile and event-driven methodologies, tailoring them to team needs, and I prioritize education over gatekeeping in knowledge sharing.
